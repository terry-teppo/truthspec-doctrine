## Contribution Philosophy

This repo documents *systemic behavior*, not functional implementation. All proposed edits must:

- Be context-rich and semantically precise
- Include rationale for behavioral impact
- Preserve the doctrine's philosophical tone and structure

Pull requests that compromise architectural clarity or behavioral autonomy will be closed.
