# 🧩 Contributing to the QuantumChain Behavioral Doctrine

Welcome, behavioral theorist. This repository documents **semantic contracts**, **runtime philosophy**, and **context-linked governance behaviors**. It is a doctrinal space—not a source code archive.

## 🔐 Contribution Principles

We accept contributions that:

- Deepen semantic precision
- Clarify subsystem behavior through aligned TruthSpecs
- Respect the architectural tone and philosophical commitments
- Include rationale for change and behavioral consequences

## ❌ What Not to Contribute

- Functional implementation, logic, or runtime source code  
- Style-only edits with no semantic or philosophical impact  
- Changes that break manifest continuity or systemic coherence  
- Unexplained rewrites or speculative subsystem additions

## 📝 How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository  
2. Clone your fork locally  
3. Add or edit files with descriptive, context-linked filenames  
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - A **manifest rationale**
   - An explanation of **intent, impact, and systemic fit**
   - Optional linkage to existing TruthSpecs in the index

## 📜 Governance Tone

QuantumChain’s behavior is **declarative** and **introspective**. Your contribution must serve mutual understanding between subsystems, maintain autonomy, and preserve context-linked happiness.

Think of yourself not as a coder—but as a behavioral cartographer.
