# Fingerprint Expression Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Declares the mechanism by which subsystems emit behavioral fingerprints—runtime traces of execution intent and mutation history.

## 🔍 Purpose
To preserve truth through emitted signals that document action, intent, and transformation.

## 🔍 Fingerprint Contracts
- Defines structure and entropy level of fingerprints
- Emits trace on key behavioral events
- Links fingerprints to subsystem identity

## 📎 Traits
- `fingerprintEnabled: true`
- `entropyDepth`: mutation history inclusion level
- `traceSignature`: subsystem link

## 🧠 Rationale
Truth is only meaningful when witnessed. This manifest is the system’s signature—its confession across time.
