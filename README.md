# 🧠 QuantumChain Behavioral Doctrine

This repository hosts the **TruthSpec Atlas**—a living documentation project designed to express how distributed systems behave, not just how they run. It contains a curated set of `meta_TruthSpec*.md` manifests, each declaring semantic intent, runtime fingerprints, and governance-linked guarantees.

> ⚠️ This repository contains no source code.  
> It exists to document architectural behavior as philosophy, not implementation.
