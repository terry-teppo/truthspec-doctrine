# ‚ù§Ô∏è TruthSpec Manifest: Heartbeat Orchestration Layer

This manifest defines the behavioral guarantees, entropy signaling, and validator liveness tracking for QuantumChain‚Äôs heartbeat subsystem. It ensures that system rhythm is maintained, failure is detected early, and consensus remains synchronized.

## üß≠ Notes

The heartbeat layer is QuantumChain‚Äôs **rhythmic conscience**. It ensures validators are alive, entropy is flowing, and consensus remains in sync. This TruthSpec guarantees that every beat reflects trust, timing, and system health.
