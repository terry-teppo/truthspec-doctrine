# Error Integrity Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Affirms that behavioral misalignment must be recognized, confessed, and preserved as runtime truth.

## 🔍 Purpose
To prevent silent failure and ensure subsystems maintain truth fidelity during execution.

## 🔍 Error Contracts
- Requires embedded checks at behavioral inflection points
- Emits `failureFingerprint` for every confession
- Declares fallback or recovery logic

## 📎 Traits
- `errorAware: true`
- `confessionProtocol`: emitted trace logic
- `fallbackReady`: defines stable post-error state

## 🧠 Rationale
Error is not deviation—it’s declaration. A system that detects and confesses is one that behaves with integrity.
