# 🧠 TruthSpec Manifest for QuantumChain

This document outlines the behavioral contracts, mutation logic, and runtime fingerprints for QuantumChain’s core modules. Unlike traditional API docs, TruthSpec aims to reflect not just *what* a system does, but *why* and *how*, based on live conditions and governance context.

## 🧩 TruthSpec Schema

Below is the standard structural interface used across all QuantumChain TruthSpecs to describe subsystem behavior:

## Why TruthSpec?

- **Human-readable intent**: Clarifies purpose beyond function signatures.
- **Semantic contracts**: Describes behavioral promises under varying states.
- **Runtime fingerprinting**: Ensures documentation matches the deployed reality.
- **Mutation context**: Connects runtime mutation with governance rationale.
- **Telemetry & trace alignment**: Documents health expectations and failure modes.

ya sounds like somthing to do - maybe people will undersatnd

You could expose this via an internal dashboard for contributors, or generate it in real time during test coverage analysis. And unlike Swagger, this wouldn't just list what something is—it would explain why it matters and how it behaves under pressure.

We could start by generating TruthSpec documents from QuantumChain’s core modules and build out a visual interface layer later.

semantic_contract - i love that - people need reality

Truth, structure, and intention—all stitched into a compact declaration of “this is what I promise to do.” That’s the magic of a semantic contract. It’s like saying: "This endpoint isn’t just responding; it’s behaving." No surprises, no implicit quirks—just functional reality.

Imagine if every system interaction had to carry its own semantic pledge: “I maintain order,” “I fail visibly,” “I mutate state with full consent.” Suddenly, people designing and consuming APIs aren’t just crossing wires—they’re collaborating on a behavioral treaty.

If you’re up for it, we can draft a semantic contract for one of QuantumChain’s subsystems. I’d love to start with the emergency halt protocol—it’s got real teeth and intention behind it.semantic_contract - i love that - people need reality

runtime_fingerprint Live hash/UUID from running implementation, linked via CI/CD - it is like you are reading my mind

f course—it’s the checksum of truth! 😄 You’re building an adaptive system; the last thing you want is documentation that drifts or lies by omission. Embedding a runtime_fingerprint means every contract, every mutation, every spec is tied directly to what’s actually running. No guesswork, no assumptions—just traceable integrity.

It’s also the antidote to stale Swagger pages and overconfident wikis. You see the spec and know: this exact build, this exact behavior. It opens the door to auto-versioned docs, mutable endpoint maps, and maybe even rollback diffing in governance proposals.

ash its current runtime config, entropy state, and telemetry snapshot, then expose it via an internal /status/truthspec endpoint. Let’s turn runtime identity into a first-class citizen.
