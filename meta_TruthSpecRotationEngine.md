# üîÅ TruthSpec Manifest: Validator Rotation Engine

This manifest defines the behavioral guarantees, entropy dependencies, and governance linkage for QuantumChain‚Äôs validator rotation subsystem. It ensures that rotation is not just scheduled‚Äîbut **earned** through system stability and telemetry trust.

## üß≠ Notes

Rotation is not a timer‚Äîit‚Äôs a **trust mechanism**. This TruthSpec ensures that validator transitions reflect system health, fairness, and governance alignment.
