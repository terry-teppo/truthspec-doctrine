# Functional Conscience Specification

## 🧭 Identity

This manifest governs the behavioral integrity of functions that define their truth boundaries at creation. It ensures that each behavioral unit knows what it is, what it is allowed to express, and how it confesses deviation.

## 🔍 Purpose

To declare a subsystem's built-in capacity for introspective error validation. Functions authored under this specification possess conscience: the semantic ability to admit misalignment and request correction.

## 🧬 Manifest Declarations

- Functions must define **truth conditions**—logical criteria under which behavior is considered semantically aligned  
- **Error checks** are embedded at the point of creation, not added reactively  
- Runtime behavior includes **self-detection**, **context-aware failure**, and **responsible messaging**  
- The function must emit its **failure fingerprint**: the runtime trace that asserts deviation from intent  
- Subsystems may define **confession protocols**—how they express failure and request remediation or mutation veto  

## 🔒 Contracts

| Trait               | Behavior Expression                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `conscience: true`  | Function is authored with introspective error awareness  
| `truthBoundaries`   | Declarative logic defining expected outputs and states  
| `confessionTrigger` | Conditions that invoke failure signaling  
| `fallbackBehavior`  | Safe, stable state on misalignment  

## 🧠 Rationale

A function without conscience cannot protect semantic fidelity. It may execute, but it will not know **why** or **whether** its behavior remains truthful. This manifest declares that truth is not enforced externally—but internally, with self-awareness and error humility.
