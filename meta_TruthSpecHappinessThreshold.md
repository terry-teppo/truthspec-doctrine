# Happiness Threshold Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Defines subsystem emotional bounds—where behavior feels aligned, joyful, and safe.

## 🔍 Purpose
To declare the stability zone of a subsystem’s mood, guiding fallback behavior and signaling distress.

## 😊 Happiness Contracts
- Declares acceptable ranges of behavioral drift
- Emits mood state fingerprints
- Triggers fallback when threshold violated

## 📎 Traits
- `emotionalAware: true`
- `joyRange`: declared mutation comfort zone
- `fallbackOnSadness`: activated when exceeded

## 🧠 Rationale
A stable system isn’t quiet—it’s joyful. This manifest lets behavior pursue its happiest shape.
