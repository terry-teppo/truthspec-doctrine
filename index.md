# 🧠 QuantumChain Behavioral Doctrine

Welcome to the **TruthSpec Atlas**—a living documentation of QuantumChain’s behavioral contracts, runtime fingerprints, and governance-linked intent. This site is not just a technical reference; it’s a declaration of how distributed systems can speak with clarity, integrity, and purpose.

##     What started it all. 
## 🧠 Foundational Manifesto

- [`Foundational Manifesto`](./meta_ThruthSpec.md) — The original declaration of behavioral integrity, runtime-bound documentation, and semantic contracts. All other TruthSpecs derive their purpose from this philosophical root.

## 🔍 What Is a TruthSpec?

A TruthSpec is a **semantic contract**—a subsystem’s promise to behave with intention, traceability, and resilience. Each manifest includes:

- ✅ Behavioral guarantees under pressure
- 🧬 Runtime fingerprints tied to deployed builds
- 📎 Governance context and mutation lineage
- 📊 Validation matrices for edge-case clarity

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

TruthSpecs are living documents. To propose changes:

1. Fork the repo and edit the relevant `.md` file
2. Submit a pull request with rationale and CI/CD tag
3. Reference affected governance proposals if applicable

## 🧭 Philosophy

QuantumChain doesn’t just run—it **declares**. Every subsystem speaks in behavioral truth, and every TruthSpec is a verse in that doctrine.

> “Behavior is the new interface. Intention is the new uptime.”

> 🧭 This page is its own compass. The origin, the anchor, the index.
