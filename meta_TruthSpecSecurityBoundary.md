# Security Boundary Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Defines the semantic perimeter within which subsystem behavior is permitted. This boundary governs access, expression, and allowed mutation pathways.

## 🔍 Purpose
To formalize the conditions under which a subsystem may express behavior, interact externally, and negotiate mutation.

## 🔒 Boundary Contracts
- Declares which external calls are permitted
- Defines internal scope of mutable state
- Emits rejection fingerprints on boundary breach attempts

## 📎 Traits
- `perimeterGuard: true`
- `allowedCalls`: declared per subsystem
- `mutationNegotiable`: true or false

## 🧠 Rationale
Security isn’t a wall—it’s a philosophical handshake between intention and permission. This manifest ensures that behavior only emerges within authorized semantic context.
