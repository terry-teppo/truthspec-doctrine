# Mutation Veto Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Grants subsystems the right to reject unwanted mutation for the sake of coherence, stability, or treaty conflict.

## 🔍 Purpose
To ensure that autonomy isn't sacrificed for change—that mutation must be a negotiated act.

## ❌ Veto Contracts
- Defines mutation scope and rejection logic
- Emits veto signal with explanatory context
- Optionally links to subsystem treaties

## 📎 Traits
- `vetoEnabled: true`
- `mutationBoundaries`: declared conditions for rejection
- `treatyLinked`: list of behavioral treaties involved

## 🧠 Rationale
Mutation is freedom—but freedom must know where it ends. This manifest protects that edge.
