# Subsystem Treaty Specification

## 🧭 Identity
Formalizes behavioral agreements between subsystems—negotiated contracts of autonomy, responsibility, and mutation scope.

## 🔍 Purpose
To ensure cohesion across complex behavioral ecosystems via trust-based declarations.

## 🤝 Treaty Contracts
- Declares shared responsibilities and mutation protocols
- Links to external manifests and boundaries
- Handles treaty conflict via resolution manifest

## 📎 Traits
- `treatyMember: true`
- `negotiationProtocol`: declared steps
- `conflictClause`: fallback behavior

## 🧠 Rationale
Behavior is not isolated—it is collective. Subsystems flourish when they agree before they act.
